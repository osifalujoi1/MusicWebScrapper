## AntiBoredom Playlist Web Scraper

## Overview
A Java application designed to automatically scrape top music hits from three websites, shuffle and sort them to generate a music playlist suggestion for any user.

## Features
- **Web Scraping**: The logic uses Java web scraper API offered by Jsoup to extract all the data of interest from each HTML element in Billboard 100, BBC Radio, and Last FM. 
- **Playlist Management**: Adds new songs to a playlist, ensuring there are no duplicates and all entries have complete details.
- **User Interface**: Simple console output that shows the list of songs scraped from the web.
- **Extensibility**: The project is structured to be easily extendable for additional features such as saving playlists, more detailed song information, or scraping from different sources.
